                            A SMART Health Card has a 2D barcode (QR code) and may look something like this; see image below. Although the other information on your SMART Health Card may vary based on your individual records, most will have the SMART logo.

                            You can keep your SMART Health Card as a record of your vaccination history and/or test results. You can also choose to share it with others (such as your doctor or a specialist your doctor refers you to or schools and other venues requiring immunization for admittance) if you want or need to show them this information.

                            SMART Health Cards do not change over time. Whenever you receive an additional vaccine or booster, you will need to request an updated COVID-19 vaccination record from the entity that provided your SMART Health Card. Note: It can sometimes take several weeks to get booster information from your vaccination location into your state's immunization registry. If you were recently vaccinated and don't see your booster appearing on your new SMART Health Card, you might need to try again after a few weeks. If you continue to have issues, you should contact the organization from which you received your vaccination or check with your state immunization registry. Here is a list of state immunization <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state" target="_blank">registries</a> and here is a list of SMART Health Card <a href="issuers.html">issuers</a>.

                            You can check that your SMART Health Card is working properly with the <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier" target="_blank">free Verifier App from The Commons Project</a> or the free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nys-excelsior-pass-scanner/id1552709177" target="_blank">Excelsior Pass Scanner app</a> if your SMART Health Card was issued by New York state. Once you've downloaded the app to a mobile device, open your QR code on another device. If using the Verifier App from The Commons Project, select “Scan vaccination record” and hover that phone over the QR code as if you are taking a photo of it. Almost immediately, the app will tell you if the QR code is “Verified” or “Not Verified.” If it appears as “Not Verified,” you should contact the organization that issued your SMART Health Card.

                                    <p><strong>MyChart:</strong> If you received your immunizations from multiple providers or in different states, you may still be able to have your immunization information loaded into a healthcare provider that is using the Epic MyChart system and is issuing SMART Health Cards. Epic has a listing of all of those providers <a href="https://www.mychart.com/LoginSignup" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                                    <p>You should be able to work with a healthcare provider using Epic's MyChart to consolidate your records, and then download your SMART Health Card. Many times, SMART Health Cards issuers are actually pulling your records from the state immunization registry, so you may find that you don't have to do anything more than enroll in a participating provider's MyChart instance, and your immunization records will automatically show up.</p>

                                    <p>If not &mdash; for example if you had vaccinations done in different states - you can still work with the provider to enter your info into their system to update your record.</p>

                                    <p>Once you have an active MyChart account and you have logged into that account, <a href="https://mychart.com/covid?topic=vaccination-credentials" target="_blank">follow the directions here</a>.

                            Different organizations have different rules for verifying COVID-19 vaccinations or test results. For example, some states and countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them, for COVID-19 as well as other healthcare credentialing. All organizations should provide options for users who don't have or prefer not to use SMART Health Cards.

                            You can destroy a paper SMART Health Card and/or delete a digital SMART Health Card at any time. If you change your mind, you may be able to get a copy from the organization that provided your vaccination or test.

                        <p class="answer">
                            You should contact the organization that performed your vaccination or test. They are responsible for the accuracy of your records and these records are the source of the information on your SMART Health Card.

                        <p class="answer">
                            The SMART Health Cards solution does not have the ability to access or update your records, only your healthcare provider or state immunization registry can do that. Each state manages their own registry of vaccinations administered in their jurisdiction. To get your immunization records corrected, you'll need to contact the vaccination provider from where you received your SMART Health Card or your state immunization registry. You can find a list of state immunization registry contact information <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            Sharing your SMART Health Card information is just like sharing a paper copy of immunization records with a school, faxing medical records to a physician's office, or using your credit card at a restaurant. You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it.

                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Yes. SMART Health Cards are an open-source standard and are based on the SMART Health Card Framework. Anyone can use the SMART Health Card Framework to build solutions that verify clinical results, and organizations all over the world have already adopted these standards for that reason as well as for numerous other use cases. For instance, with iOS 15, Apple is using the SMART Health Cards Framework to allow users to download and store verifiable COVID-19 test results or vaccination records in the Health app, Walmart has announced the creation of a digital wallet for its customers to track their health information built on SMART, and in less than one year, more than 20 states and U.S. territories have launched SMART Health Cards systems by offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccination status.

                            What's more, the SMART on FHIR API is being used throughout the healthcare community to enable interoperability, including the National Institutes of Health prioritizing SMART on FHIR for use in its research programs, Microsoft using SMART on FHIR in its Azure health product, and numerous EHR vendors, like Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts, integrating the SMART on FHIR API into their products as well.

                            An issuer is the organization that generates a SMART Health Card. Issuers are able to provide digital or paper copies of clinical information, such as vaccination or testing information, to individuals. An issuer is any organization authorized to generate these cards, including pharmacies, hospitals, healthcare providers, medical labs, public health agencies, and more.

                            When businesses require proof of vaccination, they need to know that the proof of vaccination they're seeing comes from a trustworthy source and is legitimate. The VCI Directory and the CommonTrust Network were developed to create this trust. These directories vet and approve potential issuers. Then, they openly publish the list of organizations that meet <a href="#What-are-data-aggregators-and-health-IT-vendors-and-what-role-do-they-play-in-vaccination-verification-with-SMART-Health-Cards">VCI's</a> standards. This ensures that only SMART Health Cards issued by reliable sources get approved when proof of vaccination is taking place, which means verifiers can have confidence in the reliability of a person's vaccination status when they're scanning a SMART Health Card.

                            Data aggregators and other health IT vendors play a critical role in immunization record keeping and vaccination verification. They facilitate the flow of clinical information by tackling interoperability challenges and by supporting networks and applications that give the public access to their health records. The work done by these leading healthcare technology companies is vital to helping healthcare providers and public health organizations serve their customers.

                            Immunization information systems (IIS), also known as immunization registries, can be found in all 50 United States. An IIS is a computerized public health system that includes information on all the vaccines the residents in that area have been given—helping providers and families by consolidating immunization information into one reliable source.

                            More than twenty states have already embraced SMART Health Cards by becoming issuers, giving their residents an easy way to access their own, personal immunization information that's already in their state's IIS. And more than 200 million people in the United States across all 50 states have access to SMART Health Cards through nationwide pharmacies, hospitals, clinicians, laboratories, and other healthcare providers.
