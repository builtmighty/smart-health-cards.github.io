                  If neither the state/territory/country in which you were vaccinated nor your vaccination provider is issuing SMART Health Cards, here are two alternative routes you can try for securing a SMART Health Card:

          You might be able to have your immunization information uploaded to a health care provider that is using the Epic MyChart system and is issuing SMART Health Cards. Epic has a listing of all those providers here: <a href="https://mychart.com/LoginSignup" target="_blank">Log In or Sign up | MyChart</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many times, these SMART Health Cards issuers are pulling your records from the state immunization registry, so you may find that you don't have to do anything more than enroll in a participating provider's MyChart instance, and your immunization records will automatically show up.
        </p>
          <p>
            If not - for example if you had vaccinations done in different states - you can still work with the provider to enter your info into their system to update your record.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a video from Epic for more information: <a href="https://youtu.be/rOQVTuucc54" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/rOQVTuucc54</a>

          Once you have an active MyChart account and you have logged into your account, <a href="https://mychart.com/covid?topic=vaccination-credentials" target="_blank">follow the directions here</a>. You can access MyChart through your provider's website or the MyChart mobile app.

          You might be able to access your SMART Health Card via the Express Scripts mobile app, but this is dependent on the relationship your pharmacy has with Express Scripts.

          You may need to call Express Scripts at <a href="tel:+1-877-461-9199">877-461-9199</a> to activate your account after downloading the mobile app. Not everyone will be able to get a SMART Health Card this way.
